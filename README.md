- ### Salary Raise 
- As a professional, I need your assistance in crafting a well-written email for negotiating a salary increase or a new salary for a job offer with my current or potential employer. I will provide you with all the necessary details, including my current salary, salary expectations, and relevant context. The email should be professional and persuasive, highlighting my qualifications and the value I bring to the company. I would appreciate your guidance on how to research salary data and market rates, as well as addressing any potential objections or counterarguments from my employer. Please ensure that the email is suitable for presenting to a manager or supervisor.
